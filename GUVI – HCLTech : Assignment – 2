GUVI – HCLTech : Assignment – 2

1.	E-commerce Cart System
Ans: Use LinkedHashMap<Item, Integer> because it allows you to store item quantities (for duplicates) and preserves the insertion order.

2.	Auto-Complete Feature
Ans: Use a TreeSet<String> because it stores unique words in sorted (alphabetical) order and supports efficient prefix-based searches using methods like subSet().

3. LRU Cache
Ans: Use LinkedHashMap with accessOrder = true to maintain LRU order and override removeEldestEntry() to remove the least recently used item.

4. Leaderboard System
Ans: Use a TreeSet<Player> with a custom comparator to sort players by score in descending order and ensure uniqueness.

5. Real-Time Notification System
Ans: Use a LinkedList or ConcurrentLinkedQueue to maintain FIFO order for real-time event processing.

 6. Eliminating Duplicate Emails
Ans: Use a LinkedHashSet<String> to eliminate duplicates while preserving the order of first appearance.

7. Directory Structure Simulation
Ans: Use a tree structure with Map<String, DirectoryNode> in each node to represent subfolders and files hierarchically.

 8. Priority-based Task Scheduling
Ans: Use a PriorityQueue<Task> with a custom comparator to retrieve tasks based on their priority.
