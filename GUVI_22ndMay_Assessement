3.	TS3.3: Verify that a reverse computation is also shown if supported (e.g., 1 EUR = 1.08 USD)
4.	TS3.4: Verify rounding and formatting (e.g., up to 2 or 4 decimal places depending on the currency)
5.	TS3.5: Verify that the conversion result is accurate using a reliable external exchange rate source

UAC 4: “I can view current date/time of conversion”
1.	TS4.1: Verify that the current date and time of the conversion are displayed near the result.
2.	TS4.2: Verify that the time is shown in the correct format (e.g., DD-MM-YYYY HH.mm.ss)
3.	TS4.3: Verify that the displayed time updates correctly on each conversion attempt
4.	TS4.4: Verify that the time shown matches the actual time on the device/server within an acceptable range

UAC 5: “I have a provision to look at a chart that shows the rate history for the given day”
1.	TS5.1: Verify that a chart component is available for the selected currency pair
2.	TS5.2: Verify that the chart updates correctly based on the selected currency pair
3.	TS5.3: Verify that the chart displays historical rate date for the currency day (e.g., by hour or minute)
4.	TS5.4: Verify that the chart handles cases with missing or unavailable data gracefully (e.g., shows “No Data Available”)
5.	TS5.5: Verify that hovering or tapping on the chart shows tooltips or data points (if supported)
6.	TS5.6: Verify that the chart reloads data when the user selects a different pair or refreshes the screen

Test Scenarios For Sprint 2 – User Story 3
UAC 1: “I can see the from and to currency codes”
1.	TS1.1: Verify that the selected “From” currency code (e.g., USD) is visible before conversion
2.	TS1.2: Verify that the selected “To” currency code (e.g., INR) is visible before conversion
3.	TS1.3: Verify that currency codes remain visible and accurate after conversion
4.	TS1.4: Verify that currency codes are updated correctly when a new currency pair is selected for re-conversion

UAC 2: “I can use a default amount and perform a conversion”
1.	TS2.1: Verify that a predefined default amount (e.g., 1 or 100) is displayed when the screen loads
